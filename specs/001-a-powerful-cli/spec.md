# Feature Specification: AWS Free Guard CLI Tool

**Feature Branch**: `001-a-powerful-cli`  
**Created**: September 7, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "A powerful CLI tool to protect your AWS account from unexpected charges and keep you safely within the free tier limits. with one command i should be able to make my account 100% free that will not charge me a single penny at any cost even if i enable anything and do anything in my aws account also with one command i should be able to completely clean my account and reset everything so that its like a new account"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an AWS account owner, I want a powerful CLI tool that protects my account from unexpected charges and keeps it safely within the free tier limits. With one command, I should be able to make my account 100% free, ensuring no charges occur at any cost, even if I enable services or perform actions. Additionally, with another command, I should be able to completely clean my account and reset everything so that it is like a new account.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an AWS account with existing resources and configurations, **When** the user runs the "free" command, **Then** the account is configured to stay within free tier limits, and no charges are incurred regardless of enabled services or actions.
2. **Given** an AWS account with resources and data, **When** the user runs the "clean" command, **Then** all resources are deleted, configurations are reset, and the account is restored to a like-new state.
3. **Given** an AWS account without proper credentials, **When** the user attempts to run either command, **Then** the system prompts for valid AWS credentials and fails gracefully if not provided.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the account has resources that exceed free tier limits before running the "free" command?
- How does the system handle insufficient permissions to modify or delete resources?
- What if the "clean" command encounters resources that cannot be deleted (e.g., due to dependencies or locks)?
- How does the system ensure that the account remains free after the "free" command, even with future actions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a CLI command to configure the AWS account to operate 100% within free tier limits, preventing any charges.
- **FR-002**: System MUST ensure that no charges occur, even if the user enables services or performs actions that would normally incur costs.
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a CLI command to completely clean and reset the AWS account to a like-new state.
- **FR-004**: System MUST handle all AWS services and resources during the free configuration and clean operations.
- **FR-005**: System MUST require and validate AWS credentials for authentication before executing commands.
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear feedback to the user on the status of operations (e.g., success, errors).
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle errors gracefully, such as insufficient permissions or network issues, and provide actionable error messages.

*Note: The system must be able to identify and manage all potential chargeable resources across AWS services to ensure 100% free operation.*

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **AWS Account**: Represents the user's AWS account, including credentials, regions, and associated resources.
- **AWS Resources**: Includes EC2 instances, S3 buckets, Lambda functions, etc., that may incur charges if not managed.
- **Free Tier Limits**: Defines the boundaries for free usage across AWS services, which the system must enforce.
